# Aircraft Saftey Analysis

**Author**: Noah Meakins

## Overview



## Business Problem

My company has decided to expand in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. This project uses data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights into which models of airplane can be considered the safest for commercial and private flight. The data utilized this project was provided by Kaggle.com. The dataset is from the National Transportation Safety Board and includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
